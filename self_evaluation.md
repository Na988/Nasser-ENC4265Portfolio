# Final Reflection ‚Äì ENC4265: Self-Evaluation

Now that ENC4265 is wrapping up, I have been looking back not only at assignments I have done throughout the semester, but also at how much I have grown throughout the semester, both professionally and personally. This class made me think more deeply about the way we communicate in technical fields. It pushed me to improve my writing, pay more thought to design, and be more thoughtful when creating documentation. I also found myself thinking critically about the ethical side of using new tools such as AI, which is becoming more relevant and the new thing in today‚Äôs workplaces. As a whole, this class helped me build skills that I know will be valuable in my future career.

## üìö What I Learned

This semester, I learned how to take down complex information and present it clearly to different audiences. Whether it was through a usability memo, a travel chatbot, or instructional documentation, I practiced a lot by creating content that was functional, accessible, and professional. I gained especially confidence in using Markdown, GitHub, and visual design principles, which helped me build and display my work effectively.
The manual assessment taught me how to evaluate technical materials for clarity and usability, while the procedure video and chatbot project helped me improve my instructional and digital storytelling skills. I also became more aware of tone, voice, and accessibility in digital content.

## üöÄ Career Relevance and Growth

ENC4265 really helped me move closer to where I want to be in my career. As a senior IT student interested in network design, system administration, and cybersecurity, I feel more confident now in explaining and presenting technical information to a broad range of audiences. Strong written and visual communication is a big part of IT, especially when documenting processes, writing security reports, or creating internal guides for teams.
The Projects I completed in this class will serve as real-world examples in my portfolio and job applications. I am proud of how I have been able to blend my technical skills and knowledge with more polished professional communication. In particular, the use of the chatbot project allowed me to think about user experience from both a content and development perspective, which is highly relevant to the type of tech-driven work I want to do.

## ü§ñ AI Tools and Preparedness

This semester, I made meaningful use of AI tools like ChatGPT and BoodleBox. BoodleBox was especially helpful for building my chatbot‚Äîits user-friendly interface allowed me to focus on content design and usability. At the same time, ChatGPT became a valuable brainstorming and editing partner. I have learned how to use these tools ethically and effectively, not to generate work for me, but to enhance my ideas, refine my writing, and bring more polish to my final products. More importantly, I learned how to infuse AI-supported work with my own voice, creativity, and ‚Äúmagic‚Äù‚Äîensuring that everything I submit is truly mine.

## üìù Final Thoughts and Feedback

This course was both practical and intellectually engaging. I appreciated how each assignment was built on the last and allowed for creativity, self-direction, and exploration of real-world applications. One small suggestion would be to include a brief summary video in each module. It could really help visual learners better grasp the weekly material.


Thank you for designing such a thoughtful and forward-thinking course. ENC4265 has become a highlight of my semester and helped me build communication skills I‚Äôll carry into my professional future.
