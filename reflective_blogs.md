# Reflective Blog 1: Analyzing Early Website Designs  

### Exploring the Past  
To better understand how web design standards have changed, I looked at Angelfire-powered websites from the early 2000s. I quickly noted how unusual the layout was from other current websites. The webpage lacked typical navigation bars, with buttons dispersed throughout and a visual clash of strong and light colors. I also observed the lack of a search bar, something I now anticipate on every homepage, which made it difficult to find certain content.  

### Jarring Differences  
As a modern internet user, the experience was confusing. The text was often difficult to see because of low contrast with the background, and the different styles made it appear disorganized. In addition, links were occasionally hidden behind blocks of text rather than being widely shown. There were no dropdown menus, which made navigating subcategories difficult. Furthermore, I believed that the site appeared "flat" due to the lack of interactive components or graphics that we currently include on engaging web pages.  

### Why Modern Standards Work  
Reflecting on these older styles of design, I realized why some principles, like a clean layout, simple navigation, and high-contrast colors, have become everywhere. These features focus the user experience in order to promote accessibility and simplicity of usage. While the early website may have been useful at the time, the lack of polish and organization makes it nearly ineffective now. This highlights the importance of current web design approaches in generating seamless digital experiences for users.  

### Final Thoughts  
Visiting this old site was interesting, seeing how far web design has progressed. It also reminded me of how fast technology develops, shaping user expectations along the way. While early websites were creative for their time, the web's growth has been pushed by an ongoing desire to enhance usability, a benchmark that future designers will definitely strive to meet.

## Prompt E: Analysis of Domino’s Chatbot "Dom"

["Dom"](https://www.dominos.com/chat-pizza-order/) 

**Purpose**  
Dom helps customers order food, track deliveries, and find deals. It is designed to make ordering easy and more convenient.

**Functionality**  
Dom is designed to guide users through orders, provide real-time tracking, and share promotions. However, it has limits. It does not allow many menu customizations and usually struggles with complex questions, often it will redirect users to customer service.

**User Experience**  
It is easy to use, with clear prompts and fast responses. However, it sometimes misunderstands requests and lacks personalization, as it does not recognize returning customers or offer tailored suggestions.

**Context**  
For customers, Dom offers a quick and available way to order and track food. For Domino’s, it helps reduce customer service workload and improves engagement.

**Final Thoughts**  
I think Dom is useful for basic tasks but needs to improve in menu customization, understanding user requests, and personalization to enhance the experience.  

**AI Statement:** Quillbot was used to improve this assignment's grammar and wording.

## Prompt R: Reflections on Use of AI for the Chatbot Assignment

The AI was helpful in organizing ideas, content production tasks, and polishing responses efficiently. Nevertheless, it had some limitations that needed to be resolved.

### What AI Accomplishes Easily

✅ Fast & Efficient - Produced structured content and chatbot responses in short time.

✅ Organization – Was useful in logically formatting even the most complex ideas.

✅ Creative Suggestions – Used to provide interesting wording and structuring.

### Where AI Faces Challenges

❌ Context Depth – Provided very little contextual information about Nizwa's history.

❌ Customization – Some of the responses sounded too generic or robotic.

### Feedback and Guidance

I had to refine AI responses to ensure accuracy, improve tone, and make interactions more engaging.

### AI’s Training Data: What's Part of It and What Isn’t?

✔ Conversational including history and general knowledge.

❌ Real-time information, local untapped knowledge, and confidential information.

### Prospect of AI in Chatbots

AI will be more integrated into other industries and provide realtime data while sounding human like, however ethical oversight is needed as well. For all the pros AI provides it still needs a human touch for precision and flow.

# Reflective Blog 6  

As an IT professional, I may need to write network security reports detailing cyberattacks and mitigation strategies. I experimented with generative AI (ChatGPT-4) to refine how such reports are generated.


## 1) Original Prompt  
**Prompt:**  
*"Generate a network security incident report detailing a recent cyberattack on a company's firewall. Include an overview of the attack, affected systems, mitigation steps, and recommendations for security improvements."*  

### Assessment of Generated Output  
The AI-generated report provided a general summary but lacked technical details. It did not include log entries, attack vectors, or firewall rules affected. The recommendations were too broad and not actionable.  


## 2) Revised Prompt  
**Revised Prompt:**  
*"Generate a detailed network security incident report for a cyberattack on a corporate firewall. The report should include:*  

- *Incident Summary: Describe the type of attack (e.g., SQL injection, brute force, DDoS) and when it occurred.*  
- *Timeline of Events: List key timestamps, including detection, response, and resolution times.*  
- *Log Analysis: Provide sample firewall log entries that show attack patterns.*  
- *Affected Firewall Rules: Identify security rules that were exploited.*  
- *Mitigation Actions: Explain how the attack was mitigated, including firewall configuration changes.*  
- *Security Recommendations: Suggest specific measures such as rule updates, IDS/IPS implementation, and access control improvements.*”*  

### Assessment of Revised Output  
The refined prompt produced a report with greater technical depth, making it more useful for professional IT documentation.  


## 3) AI-Generated Response  

### **Network Security Incident Report: Firewall Breach**  

#### **Incident Summary**  
On March 10, 2025, at 02:15 AM UTC, a brute force attack targeted the corporate firewall. The attacker exploited an open SSH port with weak authentication policies.  

#### **Timeline of Events**  
- **02:15 AM:** Multiple failed login attempts detected.  
- **02:18 AM:** Unauthorized access granted after 100 failed attempts.  
- **02:20 AM:** Internal system accessed from attacker’s IP.  
- **02:30 AM:** Security team identified breach and applied firewall updates.  

#### **Log Analysis**  
Mar 10 02:15:12 Firewall: Failed login attempt from 192.168.45.23 (100 attempts)
Mar 10 02:18:05 Firewall: Successful login from 192.168.45.23

#### **Affected Firewall Rules**  
- **Rule 105:** SSH access misconfigured to allow all external IPs.  

#### **Mitigation Actions**  
- Blocked the attacker's IP address.  
- Restricted SSH access to internal IP ranges.  
- Enforced multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

#### **Security Recommendations**  
- Audit firewall rules every three months.  
- Implement an intrusion detection system (IDS).  
- Require MFA for all remote access.
