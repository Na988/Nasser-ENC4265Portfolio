# Reflective Blog 1: Analyzing Early Website Designs  

### Exploring the Past  
To better understand how web design standards have changed, I looked at Angelfire-powered websites from the early 2000s. I quickly noted how unusual the layout was from other current websites. The webpage lacked typical navigation bars, with buttons dispersed throughout and a visual clash of strong and light colors. I also observed the lack of a search bar, something I now anticipate on every homepage, which made it difficult to find certain content.  

### Jarring Differences  
As a modern internet user, the experience was confusing. The text was often difficult to see because of low contrast with the background, and the different styles made it appear disorganized. In addition, links were occasionally hidden behind blocks of text rather than being widely shown. There were no dropdown menus, which made navigating subcategories difficult. Furthermore, I believed that the site appeared "flat" due to the lack of interactive components or graphics that we currently include on engaging web pages.  

### Why Modern Standards Work  
Reflecting on these older styles of design, I realized why some principles, like a clean layout, simple navigation, and high-contrast colors, have become everywhere. These features focus the user experience in order to promote accessibility and simplicity of usage. While the early website may have been useful at the time, the lack of polish and organization makes it nearly ineffective now. This highlights the importance of current web design approaches in generating seamless digital experiences for users.  

### Final Thoughts  
Visiting this old site was interesting, seeing how far web design has progressed. It also reminded me of how fast technology develops, shaping user expectations along the way. While early websites were creative for their time, the web's growth has been pushed by an ongoing desire to enhance usability, a benchmark that future designers will definitely strive to meet.

## Prompt Q: Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn? 

I used a genrative AI tool (Boodlebox) to genrate the requiered tasks in the peompt. Here is the result: 

**[ðŸ“„ View My Orginal Resume before Revision](ResumeNasserBeforeAI.pdf)**

Based on your resume, you appear best suited for positions such as:

1. Network Security Engineer/Analyst
2. IT Systems Administrator
3. Information Security Specialist
4. Network Infrastructure Engineer

This assessment is based on your strong combination of:
- Network engineering experience (OCERT internship)
- Security-focused technical skills
- System administration knowledge
- Programming capabilities
- Teaching experience showing leadership/communication skills

Suggested improvements to make your resume more appealing:

1. **Achievement Quantification**
   - Add specific metrics to your OCERT internship (e.g., number of systems secured, percentage improvement in security posture)
   - Quantify the impact of your teaching assistant role (number of students helped, improvement in class performance)

2. **Technical Skills Organization**
   - Group your technical skills into clear categories (Security, Networking, Programming, etc.)
   - Highlight the most relevant skills for your target position first

3. **Project Section Enhancement**
   - Add more specific outcomes for each project
   - Include any security-related projects given your strong background in networking/security
   - Consider adding links to live demos or repositories where appropriate

4. **Certifications Focus**
   - Move certifications section higher up
   - Consider adding more security-focused certifications given your career direction
   - Highlight any ongoing certification pursuits

5. **Professional Summary**
   - Add a brief professional summary at the top highlighting your security and networking expertise

### Reflection Points:
The AI reviewed my resume and suggested important improvements to make it more professional. The biggest change was adding a professional summary at the top. This section clearly shows my skills in network security and IT, along with my ability to speak both English and Arabic. It helps employers quickly understand my strengths.

Another key improvement was organizing my technical skills into clear categories. This makes it easier for employers to see what I can do. The AI also advised me to add numbers and specific details to my work experience, especially in my OCERT internship and teaching assistant role. This change made my resume stronger by turning general tasks into real achievements.

Through this process, I learned how to write a better resume. Instead of just listing jobs, I need to tell a story about my skills and experience. The AI also helped me see that my mix of technical skills and teaching experience makes me stand out from other job seekers. I also realized that my resume should focus on the jobs I want, like network security and IT infrastructure roles.

Finally, I now understand that my international experience and language skills are valuable. The AI showed me that these skills can help me in the global tech industry. This experience gave me a new way of thinking about how to present myself to employers.
