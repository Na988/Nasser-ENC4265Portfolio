# Reflective Blog 1: Analyzing Early Website Designs  

## Exploring the Past  
To better understand how web design standards have changed, I looked at Angelfire-powered websites from the early 2000s. I quickly noted how unusual the layout was from other current websites. The webpage lacked typical navigation bars, with buttons dispersed throughout and a visual clash of strong and light colors. I also observed the lack of a search bar, something I now anticipate on every homepage, which made it difficult to find certain content.  

## Jarring Differences  
As a modern internet user, the experience was confusing. The text was often difficult to see because of low contrast with the background, and the different styles made it appear disorganized. In addition, links were occasionally hidden behind blocks of text rather than being widely shown. There were no dropdown menus, which made navigating subcategories difficult. Furthermore, I believed that the site appeared "flat" due to the lack of interactive components or graphics that we currently include on engaging web pages.  

## Why Modern Standards Work  
Reflecting on these older styles of design, I realized why some principles, like a clean layout, simple navigation, and high-contrast colors, have become everywhere. These features focus the user experience in order to promote accessibility and simplicity of usage. While the early website may have been useful at the time, the lack of polish and organization makes it nearly ineffective now. This highlights the importance of current web design approaches in generating seamless digital experiences for users.  

## Final Thoughts  
Visiting this old site was interesting, seeing how far web design has progressed. It also reminded me of how fast technology develops, shaping user expectations along the way. While early websites were creative for their time, the web's growth has been pushed by an ongoing desire to enhance usability, a benchmark that future designers will definitely strive to meet.
