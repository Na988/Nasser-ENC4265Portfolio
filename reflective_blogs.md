# Reflective Blog 1: Analyzing Early Website Designs  

### Exploring the Past  
To better understand how web design standards have changed, I looked at Angelfire-powered websites from the early 2000s. I quickly noted how unusual the layout was from other current websites. The webpage lacked typical navigation bars, with buttons dispersed throughout and a visual clash of strong and light colors. I also observed the lack of a search bar, something I now anticipate on every homepage, which made it difficult to find certain content.  

### Jarring Differences  
As a modern internet user, the experience was confusing. The text was often difficult to see because of low contrast with the background, and the different styles made it appear disorganized. In addition, links were occasionally hidden behind blocks of text rather than being widely shown. There were no dropdown menus, which made navigating subcategories difficult. Furthermore, I believed that the site appeared "flat" due to the lack of interactive components or graphics that we currently include on engaging web pages.  

### Why Modern Standards Work  
Reflecting on these older styles of design, I realized why some principles, like a clean layout, simple navigation, and high-contrast colors, have become everywhere. These features focus the user experience in order to promote accessibility and simplicity of usage. While the early website may have been useful at the time, the lack of polish and organization makes it nearly ineffective now. This highlights the importance of current web design approaches in generating seamless digital experiences for users.  

### Final Thoughts  
Visiting this old site was interesting, seeing how far web design has progressed. It also reminded me of how fast technology develops, shaping user expectations along the way. While early websites were creative for their time, the web's growth has been pushed by an ongoing desire to enhance usability, a benchmark that future designers will definitely strive to meet.

## Prompt Q: Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn? 

I used a genrative AI tool (Boodlebox) to genrate the requiered tasks in the peompt. Here is the result: 

**[ðŸ“„ View My Orginal Resume before Revision](ResumeNasserBeforeAI.pdf)**

Based on your resume, you appear best suited for positions such as:

1. Network Security Engineer/Analyst
2. IT Systems Administrator
3. Information Security Specialist
4. Network Infrastructure Engineer

This assessment is based on your strong combination of:
- Network engineering experience (OCERT internship)
- Security-focused technical skills
- System administration knowledge
- Programming capabilities
- Teaching experience showing leadership/communication skills

Suggested improvements to make your resume more appealing:

1. **Achievement Quantification**
   - Add specific metrics to your OCERT internship (e.g., number of systems secured, percentage improvement in security posture)
   - Quantify the impact of your teaching assistant role (number of students helped, improvement in class performance)

2. **Technical Skills Organization**
   - Group your technical skills into clear categories (Security, Networking, Programming, etc.)
   - Highlight the most relevant skills for your target position first

3. **Project Section Enhancement**
   - Add more specific outcomes for each project
   - Include any security-related projects given your strong background in networking/security
   - Consider adding links to live demos or repositories where appropriate

4. **Certifications Focus**
   - Move certifications section higher up
   - Consider adding more security-focused certifications given your career direction
   - Highlight any ongoing certification pursuits

5. **Professional Summary**
   - Add a brief professional summary at the top highlighting your security and networking expertise
   - Emphasize your bilingual capabilities as a unique selling point


**[ðŸ“„ View My Resume after Revision](AIRevisedResume.pdf)**


### Reflection Points:
The AI conducted a comprehensive review of my resume and suggested several strategic improvements that significantly enhanced its professional appeal. The most notable change was the addition of a strong professional summary at the beginning, which immediately highlights my expertise in network security and IT, along with my valuable bilingual capabilities. This addition helps create a powerful first impression and sets the tone for the rest of the document.

One of the most impactful changes was the restructuring of my technical skills into clear, organized categories. This made my capabilities more easily scannable for potential employers and demonstrated a logical thought process. The AI also emphasized the importance of quantifying achievements, suggesting the addition of specific metrics to my experiences, particularly in my OCERT internship and teaching assistant role. This transformation helped translate my experiences from mere responsibilities into concrete, measurable accomplishments.

Through this process, I learned several valuable lessons about effective resume writing. First, I realized the importance of presenting information in a way that tells a coherent professional story rather than just listing experiences. The AI helped me understand that my combination of technical expertise and teaching experience is actually a unique selling point that sets me apart from other candidates. Additionally, I learned the significance of tailoring the resume to specific career paths â€“ in my case, focusing on network security and IT infrastructure roles.

Perhaps the most enlightening aspect was seeing how my international experience and bilingual abilities could be positioned as valuable assets rather than just background information. The AI helped me understand that these skills are increasingly important in our globalized tech industry and should be highlighted accordingly. This experience has given me a new perspective on personal branding and how to effectively communicate my professional value to potential employers.
