## Vehicle Safety

### Safety Guidelines

Riding a Honda Ruckus is thrilling, but safety comes first. Follow these guidelines to protect yourself and others:

- **Perform Pre-Ride Inspections:** Check tires, brakes, and fluids before every ride to catch issues early. Why? A small problem like low tire pressure can lead to a crash.
- **Avoid Sparks Near Fuel:** Keep flames away when refueling. Gasoline vapors are highly flammable, and a spark could ignite them.
- **Wear a Helmet:** Helmets reduce head injury risk by up to 85%. Always wear a DOT-approved helmet.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of you wearing a helmet with your Ruckus.*  
*Caption:* Safety starts with the right gear.

### Safety Labels

Your Ruckus has safety labels to warn you of hazards. Don’t remove them—they’re there for a reason.

- **Helmet Warning:** Located near the handlebar, it reminds you to wear a helmet. Why? It’s your first line of defense in a crash.
- **Operator Only:** No passengers allowed. The Ruckus is designed for one rider to maintain balance and control.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a close-up of a safety label on your Ruckus.*  
*Caption:* Key safety info right on the bike.

### Safety Precautions

- **Ride Defensively:** Assume other drivers don’t see you. Why? Scooters are smaller and harder to spot.
- **Protective Gear:** Wear gloves, boots, and a jacket. They protect against road rash and weather.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of your riding gear laid out.*  
*Caption:* My go-to protective apparel.

### Riding Precautions

- **Break-In Period:** For the first 60 miles (100 km), avoid hard acceleration. This helps the engine settle for long-term reliability.
- **Braking Tips:** Use both front and rear brakes together. Why? It maximizes stopping power without skidding.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of your Ruckus on a quiet road during break-in.*  
*Caption:* Taking it easy during the break-in phase.

### Accessories & Modifications

- **Honda-Approved Only:** Stick to parts designed for the Ruckus. Aftermarket mods can compromise safety and void warranties.
- **No Passengers:** Don’t modify for a second rider—the frame isn’t built for it.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of a stock Ruckus vs. a modified one.*  
*Caption:* Keeping it safe and legal.

### Loading

- **Max Weight:** 220 lb (100 kg), including rider and cargo. Exceeding this affects handling.
- **Secure Loads:** Tie items close to the center. Why? Unbalanced weight can cause tipping.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of your Ruckus with a small load tied down.*

## Operation Guide

### Parts Location

Know your Ruckus inside and out:

- **Throttle Grip:** Right handlebar, controls speed.
- **Fuel Fill Cap:** Under the seat, for refueling.
- **Center Stand:** Keeps the bike upright when parked.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a labeled photo of your Ruckus showing key parts.*  
*Caption:* My Ruckus, part by part.

### Instruments

- **Speedometer:** Shows speed in mph (USA) or km/h (Canada).

### Starting the Engine

1. Place the Ruckus on its center stand.
2. Lock the rear brake by squeezing the lever and setting the lock.
3. Turn the ignition to ON.
4. Press the start button with the throttle closed.

**Why?** The brake lock ensures stability, and a closed throttle prevents sudden revving.

### Riding

1. Push the bike off the center stand.
2. Release the rear brake lock.
3. Open the throttle slowly to accelerate.

**Why?** Gradual throttle prevents wheel spin on loose surfaces.

### Parking

1. Stop the engine.
2. Lower the center stand.
3. Lock the steering with the ignition switch.

**Why?** Locking deters theft, and the stand keeps the bike stable.

## Maintenance

### Maintenance Schedule

- **Every 600 miles (1,000 km):** Check oil and tire pressure.
- **Every 2,500 miles (4,000 km):** Change engine oil.

**Why?** Regular checks prevent wear and breakdowns.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of your maintenance log or tools.*  
*Caption:* Staying on top of upkeep.

### Engine Oil

1. Warm the engine for 2-3 minutes.
2. Remove the oil fill cap/dipstick.
3. Drain the old oil, then refill with 0.7 quarts of 10W-30 oil.

**Why?** Fresh oil lubricates and cools the engine, extending its life.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of you checking or changing oil.*  
*Caption:* Oil change in progress.

### Tires

- **Pressure:** 29 psi front, 36 psi rear.
- **Tread Depth:** Replace if less than 1/16 inch (1.6 mm).

**Why?** Proper inflation ensures grip and fuel efficiency.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of you checking tire pressure.*  
*Caption:* Keeping the tires road-ready.

### Brakes

- **Check Pads:** Replace if worn to 1 mm.
- **Adjust Lever:** Ensure firm resistance when squeezed.

**Why?** Worn brakes reduce stopping power, risking accidents.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of your brake inspection.*  
*Caption:* Brake check for safety.

## Troubleshooting

### If the Engine Won’t Start

- **Check Fuel:** Ensure the tank isn’t empty.
- **Battery:** Try the kickstarter if the electric start fails.

**Why?** A dead battery or no fuel are common culprits.

**Image Placeholder:** *Insert a photo of you troubleshooting.*  
*Caption:* Figuring out a no-start issue.

### Flat Tire

1. Move to a safe spot.
2. Use a patch kit or replace the tube.

**Why?** Riding on a flat damages the rim and is unsafe.
