## About Me 
Welcome to my profile! I am a senior IT student at the University of Central Florida, with a strong passion for network engineering, cybersecurity, and software development. During my internship at Oman National CERT, I gained hands-on experience designing secure networks, configuring firewalls, and conducting vulnerability assessments. My skill set includes Java, Python, MySQL, and tools like Wireshark and Cisco Packet Tracer. I am actively seeking a full-time position. I am eager to leverage my skills in dynamic and innovative environments. My dream job is Network Engineer.
